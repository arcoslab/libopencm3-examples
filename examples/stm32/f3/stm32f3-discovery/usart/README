This example program sends some characters on USART2 on the
ST STM32F3DISCOVERY eval board.

The terminal settings for the receiving device/PC are 115200 8n1.

The sending is done in a blocking way in the code.

The program also recieves characters and prints them with <> around
the recieved characters. 

If an overrun happens "R" is printed, and the flag is cleard to reenable
reception. 

If a framing error happens "F" is printed, and the flag is cleard to reenable
reception. 

If a parity error happens "R" is printed, and the flag is cleard to reenable
reception. (this cannot currently happen as parity is disabled). 


TODO: Figure out why
- the baud rate passed to set_baudrate is 1/4 of what is wanted. 
- the RDR is called RDR here in the code and in my datasheet, but the 
library code seems to want to use "DR" which I can't find anywhere.
